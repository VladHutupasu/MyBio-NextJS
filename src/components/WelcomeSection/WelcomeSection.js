        <h2>Hello üëãüèª</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Vlad and I am 26 years old. I am an ambitious and
          hard-working person that came in The Netherlands 8 years ago in order
          to study Computer Science. I came here, not being totally supported by
          my parents, to learn, develop myself and take on challenges and
          opportunities. Being determined, I managed to create a life of my own,
          even though in the beginning it was not easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always ready to learn something new, something useful, to gain
          experience and knowledge. I may not know everything, but I can tell
          you that I am hard-working and I can accomplish everything that I put
          my mind into.
        </p>
